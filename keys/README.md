# AWS Deployment Keys

This directory contains SSH private key files (`.pem`) used for AWS EC2 instances.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit these files to version control**
- Keys are automatically generated by the `auto-deploy.sh` script
- Each key is named with the pattern: `morfis-key-{instance-id}.pem`
- Files have restricted permissions (600) for security

## File Naming Convention

```
keys/
├── morfis-key-i-1234567890abcdef0.pem  # Key for instance i-1234567890abcdef0
├── morfis-key-i-0987654321fedcba0.pem  # Key for instance i-0987654321fedcba0
└── ...
```

## Usage

Keys are automatically used by the deployment script. For manual SSH access:

```bash
ssh -i keys/morfis-key-{instance-id}.pem ec2-user@{public-ip}
```

## Cleanup

When terminating instances, you can safely delete the corresponding `.pem` files to keep this directory clean.
